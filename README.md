# The Mastermind game

***The Mastermind Game***  is a code-breaking game. The objective is to break the code auto-generated by the computer within 6 attempts.

It is based on the board game "Mastermind", where the code to be broken is a sequence of colors.

In this version, the code to be broken is a sequence of 4 digits, from 0 to 9.

This is a pure entertainment game and a challenge for those who like to solve puzzles.

The Mastermind game is a fully responsive javascrip logic games, which will guide the player towards breaking the secret code number.

    Once the game runs, the numbers inputted by user will show the color accordingly with its position and the prior inputs will be disabled.
    - GREEN, if the number belongs to the code and if is in the right position;
    - ORANGE, if the number belongs to the code but on a different position
    - RED, if the number does not belong to the code

### Features left to be implemented

- When the game finishes, whether user wins or not, the user will be informed on the right side panel, instead of using pop-up messages

## Testing

- Tests were performed in different browsers: Chrome, Opera and Safari.
- I confirm that the game works and the result will be correct.
- I can confirm that, no matter which browse, all elements will be fully readable and easy to understand.
- I tested it through lighthouse in devtools and the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read.

- I used devtools device toolbar to ensure this project is fully responsive, looks good and works on all standard screen sizes

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs

   - **CSS not applying if using *autofill***. If "autofill form" is used, the CSS applied to the input box will be the "*internal-autofill*, instead of what was coded in the CSS file. To overturn that, I've disabled the auto-complete form on these input fields, by adding "autocomplete='off'" to the input html tags

#### Unfixed Bugs

   - No other bugs were found

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab;
    - Under "Code and automation" (left panel), click on "Pages";
    - Under "Builds and deployment", from the dropdown menu, select the Master Branch;
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page provided the link to the completed website.
