# The Mastermind game

The Mastermind game is a code-breaking game. The objective is to break the code auto-generated by the system within 6 attempts.

It is based on the board game "Mastermind", where the code to be broken is a sequence of colors.

In this version, the code to be broken is a sequence of 4 digits, from 0 to 9.

This is a pure entertainment game and a challenge for those who like to solve puzzles.

The Mastermind game is a fully responsive javascrip logic games, which will guide the player towards breaking the secret code number.
